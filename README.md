# Project Three- Windsheild Wiper Subsystem 

## System Behavior Description 
Phillip Cittadino and Catie Amirault                                                                                                                                       

This system takes a driver's education car and implements a windshield wipers system that gives the user the option to pick the speed of the wipers and the delay time of the wipers. The car must abide by the New York State Department of 
Motor Vehicles rules which states that the ignition can only turn on when both the passenger and the driver are sitting down and both seatbelts are fastened. A green LED will turn on when both conditions are met and when the ignition is on a 
blue LED turns on instead. If one or more of those conditions are not true then ignition is not possible and an alarm will sound. The driver will get an error message explaining why the car will not turn on and try to fix the problem and attempt
to turn on the ignition again. If the driver pushes the ignition button while the ignition is on, it will turn off. The wiper system allows the driver to have control over the wipers in two ways. The first feature the driver has control over is
the speed of the wipers, the wiper can either be high, low, intermediate, or off. Then, the driver can decide a delay time of either short, medium, or long. A display will show the driver what mode the windshield wipers are in. 

We decided to use a positional motor for our windshield wipers. We decided to use this motor because its movements were more accurate and it could reach the degrees specified with more precision. Due to the requirement of the wipers having to go 67 degrees this motor made more sense.
